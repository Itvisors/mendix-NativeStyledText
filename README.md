## NativeStyledText
One text which allows parts to be styled separately. This will allow for the text to break naturally at the end of the container.

You can of course in Mendix place multiple text widgets after each other.
However, if the content does not fit, one or more entire text widgets will go to the next lines,
probably causing unnatural line breaks.

## Features
- Specify multiple texts
- Optionally style each text

## Usage
- Place the widget on the page
- Add the texts you want to display.
- For each text you can enter the name of the class to add to the text
- Each text inherits the default.
- Create the custom class in your theme
